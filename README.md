Personal blog built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and MDX. I am very aware that this is an absolute overkill for a personal blog that is fully static. This blog started originally as a playground to learn Next.js and to experiment.

## Features

- **Blog Posts** - MDX-powered blog posts with syntax highlighting, math support (KaTeX), and reading time
- **Snippets** - Code snippets and system configuration notes
- **Projects** - Showcase of personal projects
- **Tags System** - Tag-based organization and filtering for blog posts and snippets
- **Search** - Client-side search functionality for blog posts
- **RSS Feed** - Auto-generated RSS feed at `/feed.xml`
- **Sitemap** - Dynamic sitemap generation at `/sitemap.xml`
- **Analytics** - Umami analytics integration
- **Dark Mode** - System-aware dark mode with theme switching
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first responsive layout
- **SEO Optimized** - Metadata and Open Graph tags for all pages
