## What's the point of this blog?

When I worked as a suit and tie chained to a desk in traditional finance we were prohibited from sharing almost
anything online. I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey.

I am currently learning web3 technologies to be able to do more first-hand research. Namely, Solidity for smart
contracts and JS (and its thousands of frameworks) for front-end.

## Brief timeline of my career

I studied Finance and Mathematics at McGill University. My first job was an investment banking analyst. I was fairly
shocked that despite the glamour and image portrayed during the interview process, you didn't really need to know
more than high-school math. I had written a slew of macros in VBA to automate most common tasks in IB that somehow
seemed like magic to pretty much everyone in the investment bank and a decade later I hear that people still use them.

Eager to do something more mentally stimulating, I completed a Master of Financial Engineering in UC Berkeley and
worked almost ten years as a quantitative portfolio manager mostly trading global macro.

Despite having dismissed crypto in 2012 after a grand total of 10-minutes of reading Financial Times, I thankfully
rediscovered it in 2016 and finally understood its premise and value-add. I was the head of blockchain research for
two years in my last job and decided to pursue it full-time after.

I love math, computer science, and finance. Blockchain is the perfect technology intersecting all three.

I am a stern believer of building multiple passive income streams.

## Tech stack

My toolkit includes a heavy dose of Python and Rust, with occasional C++ and JS/TS. I am learning Solidity
now to be able to research defi protocols first-hand.

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?ref=kaveh.page), and was absolutely overengineered with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/?ref=kaveh.page),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/?ref=kaveh.page),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/?ref=kaveh.page), and uses
[Umami](https://umami.is/?ref=kaveh.page) Cloud for analytics. Before you flame me for using Next.js for a static
blog that could've been done with plain HTML/CSS, I would say that this is more of a playground for learning. The
website is rendered server-side, served statically, and has high Lighthouse scores.
