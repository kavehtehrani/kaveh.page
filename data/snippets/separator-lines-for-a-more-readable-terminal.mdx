I find the default terminal layout a bit hard to read between where the previous command ran and ended its output.
Adding this line to your `.bashrc` file puts a horizontal line before
[each primary prompt](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html)
making it a lot more readable for me to locate the sequence of outputs.

```
PROMPT_COMMAND=$'printf %"$COLUMNS"s |tr " " "_"'
```
