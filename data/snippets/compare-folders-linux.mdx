If you want to compare two folders completely there's a handy `diff` tool in linux that looks like this:
`diff -rq folder1 folder2`. Unfortunately this does the comparison by content so if you're just trying to figure out
which files are in one folder but not the other, then `diff` is way overkill.

Here's a handy script to compare two folders on linux by filenames only.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script compares two directories recursively and lists all files and directories
# that exist in one directory but not the other, ignoring file contents.
# Usage: ./compare_folders.sh folder1 folder2

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <folder1> <folder2>"
  exit 1
fi

comm -3 <(cd "$1" && find . -type f -o -type d | sort) \
        <(cd "$2" && find . -type f -o -type d | sort) \
  | sed "s|^\t|Only in $2: |; t; s|^|Only in $1: |"
```
