It is always a good idea to read the code for an extension to see what it is actually doing. Especially if it's a
less popular extension you are not so sure about.

## Bash Script

You can run this bash script and pass in the Chrome extension ID as a parameter. It will automatically download it
and unzip the source code. To obtain the extension ID, just get it from the end of the URL while navigating the
Chrome web store. For instance the ID for
[Google Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) is:
_aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb_.


```
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
echo "Need to pass in the extension ID as a parameter"
exit 1
fi

extension_id=$1   # ID of the chrome extension obtained from the chrome extension store
curl -L -o "$extension_id.zip" "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&os=linux&arch=x64&os_arch=x86_64&nacl_arch=x86-64&prod=chromium&prodchannel=unknown&prodversion=91.0.4442.4&lang=en-US&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&x=id%3D$extension_id%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc"
unzip -d "$extension_id-source" "$extension_id.zip"
rm "$extension_id.zip"
```

## Web Apps

There are also a couple web apps that you can use. Here are a couple that I found useful:
