Having used ChatGPT for a while, I have gotten used to the "dictate" feature which allows me to speak and transcribe my words into text.
Given that I've become a fairly heavy user of Cursor AI, I wanted to replicate this experience on my Ubuntu desktop. Surprisingly, I was
not able to find any native or readily available speech-to-text solution. So I decided to create a
[GNOME extension](https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text) that would allow me to do just that.

Since the advent of AI programming, I've found myself far more open to exploring unfamiliar technologies and programming languages.
It's made me far more likely to just dive into an unfamiliar tech stack, knowing that I can ask for help and get guidance along the way,
at least in the early stages of learning.

My plan was to use this opportunity to learn how to create a GNOME extension, which I had never done before. Since Linux is written primarily in C,
I was ready to brush up on my C skills.

## Getting Started

I took a look at the [GNOME extension documentation](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/creating.html) and found it a bit dry.
So I headed over to ChatGPT and asked it to walk me through the process of creating a GNOME extension.

JavaScript? What? I was expecting to use C, but it turns out GNOME extensions are primarily written in JavaScript.
I obviously had to ask ChatGPT why that's the case.

Alright! That makes sense. I know enough JavaScript to get started, so off we go. After some back and forth with ChatGPT
regarding the best option to use for the speech-to-text functionality, I decided to use
[openai-whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). I gave it a try on my machine using English and Spanish, and it seemed to work well and was fast enough.

At this point I moved to Cursor, which has become my primary coding environment. I rely mostly on Claude Sonnet 4, and find the
"thinking" version to mostly be better at complex tasks than the regular version. I gave it the folder structure it needed
for the GNOME extension, and it did a reasonable job of writing the python extension code to interface with the Whisper API.

It also did a first pass at the JavaScript code to handle the UI and interaction with the GNOME shell, but that was not quite right.
I have noticed that AI tends to struggle with versioning and compatibility issues, and despite telling it I was using GNOME Shell 46,
it was using a mix of GNOME Shell 44 and 45 APIs. After some digging around in the
[GNOME Shell 46 documentation](https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html), I was able to correct the issues
and get the extension working.

## Implementing Features

Initially, Claude went off the deep end using PyAudio for audio recording, which was not necessary since I could just use FFmpeg,
which I'm more familiar with and openai-whisper relies on. I tried the python script on a few audio files in English and Spanish, and it worked quite well.

The GNOME extension itself is fairly simple. It adds a microphone icon to the top panel, which you can click to start recording. I wanted to
also add a keyboard shortcut I could use to toggle recording. This is where I ran into the most significant issues with vibe coding.

I was entirely unfamiliar with the [GSetting interface](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/preferences.html) for GNOME extensions, and it took me a while to figure out how to
get it working. I had to feed the GSettings schema to Claude manually, one bit at a time, until it understood how to set up the preferences dialog.
Then came the modal popup for the recording, which I also had to tweak a bit to get it working correctly with the GNOME Shell 46 APIs.

I spent a few hours on a bug where if the user triggered the recording modal via clicking on the top panel icon, it would not close if the user
used the keyboard shortcut to stop the recording, which was super weird. They were using the exact same code. Finally, I realized the issue was the focus
being left on the top bar even though the modal was open. I pointed this out to Claude, and after a few trials I figured it was not able to restore the focus,
so I wrote a decent amount of code to handle that manually.

Most other issues Claude was able to nail down quickly if I just pointed out the issue. To list a few: redirecting output of the python script to the system journal
so I could see the output in `journalctl`, handling keyboard events while the modals were open (after the focus issue was resolved), and
almost all styling issues with the modal popups.

Within a weekend I had the extension working well enough. I was also using it while developing it, which gave me a lot of insight into the user experience
and was gratifying to see it work in real-time.

## How Vibe Coding Helped

Honestly, the vibe learning part was the best. I had to look up minimal documentation to get started and get at least the scaffolding in place.
The vibe coding part was also smooth, but when I did hit roadblocks, AI was completely going off the rails or into a circular reasoning loop.
This persisted no matter what model I was using, so especially when it came to fixing the focus + keyboard capture issue, I had
to really get involved and fix the issue myself.

Refactoring the code was also a breeze. I was able to get Claude to help me clean up the code and make it more modular and maintainable.
I didn't even bother reading anything that was purely refactoring or styling. It just worked! Which is great, because dealing with
styling issues is probably my least favorite part of coding.

Now, the shell scripts to install the extensions were an absolute crutch with Claude. I haven't written many shell scripts in the past,
let alone one [like this](https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text/blob/main/scripts/install.sh) that installs the extension. I can
certainly read it and adjust as needed, but I confidently think that Claude did a much better job than I could've done.

I think the best part of vibe coding is the feeling that you're not entirely on your own in the process. I've found that in the past
2 years I have become much more open to exploring unfamiliar technologies and programming languages. When GitHub Copilot was first released,
I used it extensively to [learn Rust](/blog/polkadot-blockchain-academy) in a matter of weeks.

Now I was able to vibe learn and vibe code a GNOME extension in a weekend, which I figure pre-AI would have taken me at least a week and a lot
more frustration. It was a pretty magical moment to get an icon in the top panel on the first shot, so I had a visual cue that the extension was
on its way.

## Where Vibe-Coding Failed

Vibe coding definitely comes with a few serious issues. As mentioned before, versioning is a huge issue and I had to feed it specific version guidelines to get
it right for GNOME Shell 46. On some issues, particularly when it came to fixing errors, when it got stuck it would just keep repeating the same things
repeatedly, and I had to manually point it in the right direction.

Lastly, when I asked for some simple modularization of the code to break it into smaller chunks, it completely went off the rails and
not only delivered a broken solution, but also added some really weird code such as a deepCopy() function that was literally just copying objects of strings.
I had to manually rollback and fix all of that while explaining to Claude why it was wrong. What's more interesting is that even though in the prompt
I had told it to "simply refactor and modularize the code" and "do not change any functionality," it still went off the rails and made breaking changes and was
confident about it too!

## Afterthoughts

Honestly, I'm blown away by how much I was able to accomplish in such a short time. I had never written a GNOME extension before, and I was able to get
something working within a weekend. I learned a lot about GNOME Shell and its extensions, and had to look up minimal documentation to get going.

I think the key takeaway is that vibe learning and vibe coding can be a powerful combination. I've submitted the extension to
https://extensions.gnome.org/ but it is still under review. In the meantime, I've installed it on two other machines and the installation
script seems to be working well.

## Try It Out

The extension is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text) and you can install it using the provided setup instructions.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out. I wrote the majority of this article just by talking
to my computer and not typing, which kinda feels magical being able to just talk and not type anything...!
