Having used ChatGPT for a while, I have gotten used to the "dictate" feature which allows me to speak and transcribe my words into text.
Given that I've become a fairly heavy user of Cursor AI I wanted to replicate this experience on my Ubuntu desktop, surprisingly I was
not able to find any native or readily available speech-to-text- solution. So I decided to create a GNOME extension that would allow me to do just that.

Since the advent or AI programming, I've found myself far more open to exploring unfamiliar technologies and programming languages.
It's made me far more likely to just dive into an unfamiliar tech stack, knowing that I can ask for help and get guidance along the way,
at least in the early stages of learning.

My plan was to use this opportunity to learn how to create a GNOME extension, which I had never done before. Since Linux is written primarily in C,
I was ready to brush up on my C skills.

## Getting Started

I took a look at the [GNOME extension documentation](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/creating.html) and found it a bit dry.
So I headed over to ChatGPT and asked it to walk me through the process of creating a GNOME extension.

JavaScript? What? I was expecting to use C, but it turns out GNOME extensions are primarily written in JavaScript.
Obviously had to ask ChatGPT why that's the case.

Alright! That makes sense. I know enough JavaScript to get started, so off we go. After some back and forth with ChatGPT,
regarding best option to use for the speech-to-text functionality, I decided to use the
[openai-whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). Gave it a try on my machine using English and Spanish and it seemed to work well and was fast enough.

At this point I moved to Cursor, which has become my primary coding environment. I gave it the folder structure it needed
