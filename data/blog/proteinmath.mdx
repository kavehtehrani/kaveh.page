I aim to take somewhere between 150-200 of protein per day. Normally about 75g of those are supplemented via protein powders
or protein bars. I've long had a spreadsheet of my favorite brands that I use to calculate my macros + order the cheapest
one in bulk when I run out. There's at least 7-8 brands which I trust the quality (most importantly, not amino spiking) and
whose taste I find enjoyable. Amongst those, then the deciding factor simply becomes the price. Normally I just go with my
favorite brands (which is Myprotein, and no I am not getting paid for this) but I've noticed that the prices have been
swinging quite noticeably the last couple of years.

I figured if I am doing this, other people might be doing the same. For a weekend project, I decided to start scraping
some prices from the retailers I use and automate this comparison. I was in for a few surprises.

## Scraping

Most retail websites do not allow scraping of their information. That's not terribly surprising. For instance this is Myprotein's
[robot.txt](https://www.myprotein.com/robots.txt). What I did find surprising however is that almost none have
any sort of API calls either. I looked at some of the ones I had used in the past, iHerb, GNC, etc. Even the ones
that have affiliate program (e.g. [GNC](https://www.gnc.com/affiliate.html))do not really provide a method
to programmatically pull in their information. Walmart does have an API, but the bar to get access is not worth pursuing
for a side hobby of this scale.

The only viable path I found was [Amazon Associate](https://associates.amazon.com/) program. The sign-up was fairly easy,
but the access to their [API](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/) requires approvals. You need to generate
3 qualifying sales
