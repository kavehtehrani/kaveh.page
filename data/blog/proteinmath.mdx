I aim to take somewhere between 150-200 of protein per day. Normally about 75g of those are supplemented via protein powders
or protein bars.

I've long had a spreadsheet of my favorite brands that I use to calculate my macros + order the cheapest brand I like
in bulk when I run out. There's at least 7-8 brands whose quality I trust (most importantly, not amino spiking) and
whose taste I find enjoyable. Amongst those, then the deciding factor simply becomes the price. Normally I just go with my
favorite brands (which is Myprotein, and no I am not getting paid for this) but I've noticed that the prices have been
swinging quite noticeably the last couple of years.

I figured if I am doing this, other people might be doing the same. For a
[weekend project](https://www.proteinmath.app/), I decided to start scraping
some prices from the retailers I use and automate this comparison. I was in for a few surprises.

## Scraping

Most retail websites do not allow scraping of their information. That's not terribly surprising. For instance this is Myprotein's
[robot.txt](https://www.myprotein.com/robots.txt). What I did find surprising however is that almost none have
any sort of API calls either. I looked at some of the ones I had used in the past, iHerb, GNC, etc. Even the ones
that have affiliate program (e.g. [GNC](https://www.gnc.com/affiliate.html)) do not really provide a method
to programmatically pull in their information. Walmart does have an API, but the bar to get access is not worth pursuing
for a side hobby of this scale.

The only viable path I found was [Amazon Associate](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) program. The sign-up was fairly easy,
but the access to their [API](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/) requires approval.

Seeing that the path of least resistance was Amazon, I set the goal to qualify for Amazon's
[Product Advertising API (PA API)](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/).

## Amazon Associate Program

Signing up as an Amazon Associate was reasonably painless. You fill in the application and list your app, and you get conditional approval.
The PA API, however, is not automatically granted when you sign up as an associate. You need to generate 3 qualifying sales
in 6 months and abide by the [program policies](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies).
The only tool available to you in the beginning is generating links via
[SiteStripe](https://associates.amazon.ca/help/node/topic/GJMMT7G4C8K4Y3AY).

A specially difficult one for me was this condition:

>In addition, if you choose to display prices for any Product on your Site in any “comparison” format (including through
the use of any price-comparison tool or engine) together with prices for the same or similar products offered through
any website or other means other than an Amazon Site, you must display both the lowest “new” price and,
if we provide it to you, the lowest “used” price at which the Product is available on the Amazon Site.

Given that I was building a comparison shopping website, lack of access to PA API meant that I had to manually update the prices.
Scraping also broke their policy. So I put a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that this is a demo website only,
prices are manually updated, and should not be relied on.

I listed about 40 protein powders that I was familiar with and started updating their prices once a day manually.

About 2 months later, I finally got approved for the program and got access to the PA API.

### PA API

PA API is easy to use. The [SDK](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/quick-start/using-sdk.html) works
quite well and the provided code basically got me 90% of the way there. That said, I was surprised that the information
you can retrieve is a small amount of the information available on Amazon's website. Most notably, you cannot readily pull in the
reviews or all pictures of a product.

That said, the thing that mattered to me the most was having up-to-date prices and the SDK does that just fine.

I had to contact support a couple of times and found them to be responsive and generally knowledgeable. The documentation
could use some improvement, however. When I wanted to expand the comparison to other regions, found out that you had to apply
for each region to be approved separately and cannot use the same approved account for instance on amazon.co.uk. You can
set your shop to be available in multiple regions through
[OneLink](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/resource-center/onelink-launch) but that's apparently a completely
separate program.

## Tech Stack

I built the frontend with Next.js which I've found to be my preferable frontend framework. Straightforward to get
everything working especially with a lot of help for boilerplate code from Claude.

The backend is python code given that I only need prices updated 1-2x a day and the SDK code was already in python. Aside
from dealing with the regional quirks mentioned above that got me lost in the documentation, was fairly painless otherwise.
As for database, Supabase was plenty good for this project.

Right now the updates are automated with cron jobs on my homelab, but I think I'll migrate to Airflow when I find the time.

## Marketing

I haven't done much marketing around the app. I've been replying to some comments on reddit where people have asked
for a comparison of protein powder macros or prices with genuine attempt at helping and if appropriate, stating that I
have built this tool that I personally use myself.

I'm mostly relying on the SEO traffic which is slow to pick up but the initial start has been promising.

## Further Work

Since launching, I've added protein bars as well. If you think of other products you'd like see comparisons for, please
do let me know! I might add other supplements I take, e.g. creatine, fish oils, etc., but since I don't think
there's too many choices there not sure how useful that would be.

It is making beer money at the time, but if it picks up I might sink more resources to it down the line.

It was a really fun project to build and I learned quite a bit about what makes Amazon such a successful giant!
