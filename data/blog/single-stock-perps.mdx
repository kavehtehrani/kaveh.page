## Financial Engineering

### 24-Hour Trading

Crypto is the first truly 24/7 market. Even FX markets have a break. By allowing 24-hour trading on the perps, you can trade
around the clock without having to worry about the stock market hours. It would also provide a way to gauge where the market is headed
as the news roll in but the stock market is closed.

### Leverage

It's not doubt that people love leverage. That's why there has been a fairly consistent contango in the crypto futures markets normally
in the doubt digits. Perps would allow you to trade with leverage, although you would have to be careful about the funding rates. A combination
of fixed-expiry futures and perps would be ideal to gain exposure to the underlying with leverage.

### Long Stock + Short Future = Voting Rights.

Bankers love financial engineering. That's no secret. Right now the most effective way to get voting rights in a company is to buy the stock,
try to get seats on the board, and then try to influence the company. This is a risky and arduous process, and it doesn't always work out.
Proxy wars are even more difficult. Toeholds are common to help along the way, but they are not always effective. Having liquid futures on a stock would allow you
to effectively strip out the voting rights and trade them separately.
