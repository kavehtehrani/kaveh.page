This past month I attended my first Devcon ever as a volunteer. I chose the volunteer path because I wanted active
involvement in the community and meeting like-minded people, particularly now that I am spending more time in East
Asia. I have attended several crypto conferences by now and generally find them to be less about learning and more
about networking, product launches, sales booths, and parties.

Devcon is a conference geared toward developer and researchers. It was an incredibly well-organized event with
several tracks and workshops with varying levels of difficulty. I attended as many as I could, but even then, the
real value of going to a conference is not attending the talks but meeting people in person. After all, all the
talks are recorded and freely available on the Ethereum Foundation's
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@EthereumFoundation/playlists) page. At the end of this page, I've linked some of
my favorite talks that are certainly worth watching. The calibre of speakers and the depth of the content is unlike
anything I had seen before. It certainly lived up to the reputation.

It is also worth noting that Devcon specifically prohibits distribution of swag, sale booths, and other commercial
activities you would find at a general-purpose conference. The focus is on the content and the community, not
generating revenue from sales booths. This format works exceptionally well and I hope it stays that way.

Instead you have workshops and a lot of
[Community Hubs](https://forum.devcon.org/t/introducing-the-14-devcon-sea-community-hubs/4428) which were incredibly
informative and hands-on. The Home Operators Hub also had a good number of people from
[ethstaker](https://ethstaker.cc/) community which is one of my favorite communities in the Ethereum space. It was
great to meet so many of the people who I admire and without them my solo staking journey would've been far less smooth.

It is worth noting that there are several events starting a year before Devcon actually takes place called
[Road to Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/road-to-devcon/) and I attended a couple of them when I had the chance in
Bangkok earlier this year organized by [ETHPadThai](https://ethpadthai.org/). I love that name btw!

## What Do You Do As a Volunteer?

tldr; whatever is needed! I was assigned as a stage volunteers, and my main task was making sure the speakers made
it on-time to the designated stage and the talks went smoothly. I also helped in with some of the wellness
activities so other volunteers could take a break when short-staffed. It never felt like a chore, and I thoroughly
enjoyed all the volunteers that I was with.

I have volunteered a couple of times at PyCons and really enjoyed the experience. Devcon was a whole different level
and I cannot wait for next year's Devconnect.

Especial shoutout to the organizers and the volunteer leads (Shyam and Morgane you two are my MVPs!) who somehow
managed  ~13k attendees and a 300ish army of
volunteers. The amount of planning and coordination that goes into an event of this scale is mind-boggling, yet they
pulled it off and made it look easy too!

## Side Events

If you have ever attended a crypto conference, you would know that side events are kind of the main event. It's a
bit of a weird dynamic because you have multiple side events happening and some times the main events ends up fairly
empty. Devcon makes an active effort to limit side events, even then there was something like +900 side events jammed
in a week of activity. Given the huge attendance of Devcon (this year was just shy of 13k people) other conferences
get organized just before and after. Right before Devon there was the
[DeFi Security Summit](https://defisecuritysummit.org/) and the first week you had several overlapping one-day
conferences like the DuneCon, Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress, GeckoCon, you get the point.

One particular event that I really enjoyed and would highly recommend was the Bankless Summit organized right after
Devcon which featured TED-style talks. I highly recommend you check them out as the videos get uploaded
[here](https://www.youtube.com/@Bankless/videos).

Goes without saying there were plenty of rooftop drinks, social dinners, parties, etc. to your heart's content. I went
out every day after the conference and met a plethora of super interesting and driven people from all over the world.
One particular group I really enjoyed were a 30ish community of eth developers from Iran, which I had no idea about
beforehand. It's amazing to see how the decentralized nature of Ethereum permeates the intense internet censorship
in Iran.

From all the parties I went to, [rAAVE](https://x.com/raave) has a special place in my heart. The venue, the music,
the crowd, the atmosphere. Hard to live up to the hype and exceed it!
