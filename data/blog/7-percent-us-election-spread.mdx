## No, you do not have to know who will win.

At the time of writing this article,
[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1725278287257)
has odds of Harris winning the election at ~47%.

Now head over to
[PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7456/Who-will-win-the-2024-US-presidential-election)
and Harris is leading by 55%. Interestingly,
the chance of Harris NOT becoming president is trading at 46%.

So Harris winning or not winning election is sitting roughly
at a combined ~93%. Factoring transaction costs, that's 6-7% spread waiting for you to be picked up.

### The Bet

Buy "No" on Harris on PredictIt at 46c and buy "Yes" on Harris on Polymarket at 47.4c, and you'll have a 6.6c lock on
your money invested. That's a cool 7% return betting on a (almost) sure thing.

### Wait! You said 30% in your clickbait title?

6-7% between now and January 20th is 18-45% depending on when the market resolves. If the election is called a few
days after Tuesday, November 5th, then your annualized return would be closer to 35%. If it gets dragged out all
the way to inauguration day on January 20th, then annualized return drops to 20%. Read the footnotes of both
contracts to understand how they will resolve.

### Why are the two markets apart?

I can think of a few reasons. Polymarket is blockchain based so it is in theory accessible worldwide. PredictIt is
New-Zealand based with fiat money and has many geographical restrictions and not even available in my home country
of Canada. It's safe to assume that the audience of PredictIt is a regional subset of Polymarket and there is a lot more
friction to use it. It clearly shows in the wider spreads and less liquidity.

### Is this free money then?

Almost. There's never any free money. But in this case, almost.

In 2021, I traded in size an even more outrageous mispricing on
[Polymarket contracts for Inauguration day](https://kaveh.page/blog/free-money-election-day). In this case
unfortunately you will have counterparty risk on two platforms, which is definitely something to consider. Crypto is
risky, and you run several risks inherent to DeFi which you should be aware of. PredictIt is a regulated
entity subject to the wrath of regulators and last major market similar to it, InTrade, went up in flames.

Election prediction markets are wild. Last time I bet substantial amounts was on
[Harris winning the candidacy](https://polymarket.com/event/democratic-nominee-2024/will-kamala-harris-win-the-2024-democratic-presidential-nomination
) at 90c, a full day **after**
[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/biden-drops-out-election-2024/card/kamala-harris-has-locked-up-more-than-50-of-delegates-needed-to-win-nomination-0UzdqWFeiqrFOpLG2w4C)
had reported that Harris' nomination was basically a done deal. That contract traded all the way to August 21st
until it was official during the Democratic National Convention, a full 3-weeks after the outcome was effectively
sealed.
