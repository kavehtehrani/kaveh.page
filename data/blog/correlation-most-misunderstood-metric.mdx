Let's start out with a simple test. In the image below, are returns of the Stock 1 (cyan)
correlated with the returns of Stock 2 (green) positively or negatively?

<CorrChart />

If you answered postively, you are hardly alone. In fact, the returns of Stock 1 and Stock 2 have a
**perfect correlation of negative one** in their returns. Even though they are both increasing, and start and end **at
the same value**.

A common misconception is that if two series are moving the same direction that means they are positively correlated.
There are plenty of articles in financial literature that claim exactly this. See
[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-difference-between-positive-correlation-and-inverse-correlation.asp#:~:text=A%20positive%20correlation%20is%20evident,move%20in%20the%20opposite%20direction.),
and [Robinhood](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/5i1TXxjPdGJTnK6dpaH08X/what-is-positive-correlation/) here for
instance:

>A positive correlation indicates that two variables have a relationship with each other and move in the same
direction â€” when one rises or falls, so does the other.

That is not true, and unfortunately an all-too-common belief that misses a crucial point about
correlation. You cannot generally tell the correlation of two stocks, or any time-series for that matter, by looking
at a chart.

In the chart above, Stock 1 and Stock 2 are both increasing every day **together** in the same direction, yet they
are perfectly negatively correlated. You can see the values here in this
[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ehpx_qv5WS2hmp3Y7mkVLzDlbizI-MCSQfCTHTyIKmk/edit#gid=0). How can this be then?

It is because correlations are calculated **around the mean**, and do not indicate direction whatsoever. If you look
at the correlation formula below, you can see that the mean of each series in deducted in the numerator. That means
that if two series are positively correlated, they are moving together **with respect to their own individual means**.


![Correlation Formula](/static/images/corr.svg)

Correlation on its own has no information about the direction of time-series. The only metric indicating long-term
direction is the average.

In the chart above, Stock 1 and Stock 2 are both increasing at the **average** rate of 2.5 units every step,
however they are increasing in alternating [1, 4] and [4, 1] increments. This means that when Stock 1 is increasing
by 1 unit (below
its average of 2.5), Stock 2 is increasing by 4 units (above its average of 2.5), thus the perfect negative
correlation between the two.

Now can you guess the correlation between Stock 1 and Stock 3?

_Note that throughout this article we discussed the most common measure of correlation, which is the [Pearson
Correlation Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation)._
