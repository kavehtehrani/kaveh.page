Last year I spun an Ethereum validator after having used pooled staking for a while. What prompted the
action was the desire to contribute to Ethereum network's decentralization and robustness given that I had the
hardware and required eth to run a solo staking validator.

## Client Diversity

It is no secret that Ethereum has a [client diversity](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/client-diversity) problem.
While the consensus layer diversity has
improved over the last year to bring Prysm under acceptable limits, [Geth's +80% share](https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution) as an execution client is
absolutely a risk and needs to be addressed.

When spinning up my validator, I chose [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/nethermind-client), a
minority client, as my execution layer to help diversity away from Geth. Yesterday I woke up to see my validator is
offline. A quick check of the logs made it clear that the issue lies with the client and a trip to EthStaker
and Nethermind's discord channel confirmed what was going on. A [hotfix](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.25.2) was
released in a few hours and everything was up and running again.

A postmortem is not available yet at the time
of this writing, so I do not know how this escaped the testnet and impacted the mainnet directly. Nonetheless, kudos
to the
Nethermind team for promptly addressing the issue. And a sincere thank you to all the fellow stakers who run minority
clients.

This experience sent me looking deeper what could have happened if the same had happened to Geth. To be clear, this
is not throwing shade at Geth at all. They are an amazing team of engineers and have done a stellar job. Client
diversity is a feature of Ethereum and helps bolster the network's decentralization in one more dimension.

## Why is Geth so Popular?

The main reason for Geth's popularity is the heavy usage by [pooled / centralized solutions](https://execution-diversity.info/) running staking as a service. Aside from
having the longest track record, Geth is also a bit lighter on [hardware requirements](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/eth-clients) vs
other clients.
Nonetheless, staking on Ethereum was designed to be accessible for solo stakers and plenty of inexpensive consumer
grade hardware
can run a full node.

## Risks to the Network

Running an Ethereum validator comes with [rewards and penalties](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties)
and while being offline for a few hours wouldn't normally be a big deal, if 1/3 of the validators are offline then the
chain
wouldn't be able to reach finality and enters an emergency protocol called ["inactivity leak"](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties#inactivity-leak).
If what happened to Nethermind had happened to Geth, then Ethereum would have entered the emergency protocol and
depending on how fast the network recovers, potentially millions of eth could've been wiped out given the quadratic
nature of
penalties during a majority blackout. While extremely unlikely, a few days of blackout on Geth has the potential to
wipe out the entire 32 eth stake of each validator!

[Dankard Feist](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2022/03/24/run-the-majority-client-at-your-own-peril.html) has a great write-up that digs deep into this scenario.

## Cost of Being Offline

Normally a validator that goes offline accrues a penalty equal to the amount it would have earned instead. With
validator reward hovering around 2.5% at the time of writing, this is nothing to sweat about for a few days. However,
if 1/3 of validators go offline, then the chain cannot finalize and quadratic penalties kick in. Other factors such
as being in a [sync committee](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/committees/) might exacerbate the
penalty.

It is worth emphasizing that while a full blackout of the network is extremely unlikely, none of us is above
Murphy's law. Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

## What You Can Do

The above sound pretty scary, but here are a few things that mitigate a prolonged blackout (measured in days)
that you can do right now to protect yourself and help the network along the way.

* **Switch Clients** - Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon are tried and tested execution clients that can be switched over
to **right now**.
Syncing normally takes a few hours with a fast internet connection. In the case of a blackout with other validators
offline there will be
fewer peer nodes to connect to, but the mechanism is in place. **This is the best mitigator** and if you run an
ethereum node you should diversify away from Geth as soon as possible. In non-centralized staking solutions such as
Dappnode, Rocket Pool, or your own hardware, switching client is as easy as clicking a few buttons or running a few
command lines.

* **Solo Staking** - The best way to help the network is running a [solo staking validator](https://ethereum.org/staking/solo). The hardware
requirements are accessible and while 32 eth is a substantial sum, there are a variety of pooled staking such as
Rocket Pool you could consider. Staking on centralized exchanges however, while might be the "easy" option is
generally not a good idea. As always, not your keys, not your coin.

* **Exiting Validators** - The [exit queue](https://www.validatorqueue.com/) has been a few hours long at most for a
while now, but you do **not** need your own node to be running to be able to exit your validator. As long as you
have set an exit address (which should have happened when you generated your validator keys), then you can simply
use a tool such as [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/tools/broadcast) and exit your validator. This helps the
network finalize faster and stop your penalties. The queue will surely swell if there is a rush to the gate, but
nonetheless an important mechanism in place.

* **Running 2 Ethereum Nodes** - This is more suited to professional setups or if you are running more than one
validator. That said, you can run two full nodes and switch your validator over to the functional one, should one go
out.

## Final Words

As the saying goes, any decentralized network is only as decentralized as its most centralized part. Geth's
supermajority status is a risk to the network that while extremely unlikely can have an effect similar to [the DAO](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) fiasco
that I think few of us would want to live through again.

If you have the time and the means to run a solo staking validator, consider running a minority client. Not
only it is a hugely educational undertaking, it will help bolster the overall network's health, and you will collect
financial rewards on your validator as well. Who knows, might even get a juicy MEV-charged block too!
