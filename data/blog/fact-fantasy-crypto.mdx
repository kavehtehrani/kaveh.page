If what you know about crypto and blockchain is from mainstream media, chances are, like me when I first read about
it, you learned it all wrong.

Allow me to explain. How many times have you heard that bitcoin is a "cryptocurrency"? What about "blockchain"?
Neither of those words appear in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Verify for yourself [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

The mainstream financial media has largely gotten crypto wrong, and while the coverage has improved greatly, some
such as Financial Times, otherwise a respected and worthy financial newspaper, have become running jokes. See the
end of this article for a non-complete summary of FT's coverage of bitcoin, where it has consistently called bitcoin
a bubble (tulip mania is a favorite comparison), a ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme, criminal laundries, etc. A one month
FT subscription runs you about $40 a month. If instead of one month of FT you would've bought BTC in 2013 where it
averaged ~250/BTC, at the time of writing this article with BTC hovering around 37k, your $40 would've been nearly 6k.
It can't be healthy for your mental sanity to be wrong for that long and still keep up the same tune.

As the crypto markets heats up again, yet again the same old topics come out and my phone is once again buzzing with
people asking whether they should buy eth or sol, are NFTs back, or what the next major airdop would be. You will
find none of that in this article. However, I do intend to the best of my ability to get separate facts and fiction
about cryptos.

## Crypto has no use
Still shockingly common, usually said by people in the western developed world who have never visited another
country outside their 2-week all-inclusive resort elsewhere. Bitcoin's primary use is a [store of value similar to
that of gold](/blog/bitcoin-as-digital-gold). To see it in use, take a trip Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador,
Venezuela, Iran, Turkey, China, South Korea, do I keep going...? Note that while most countries where cryptos are
used regularly have unstable currencies or high inflation, some like South Korea actually have
well-functioning and developed financial systems that necessitate use of crypto to get around tight capital controls.

Financial Times has been calling Bitcoin a modern-day "tulip mania" for over a decade by now.
